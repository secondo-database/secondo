# This extension needs the NLopt library.
#
# NLopt can be obtained from
#
# http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt
#
#
# To activate this extension, some procedures need to be done:
#
# 1)
# The NLopt library needs to be installed, either manually or with the
./install_nlopt.sh 
# script, if the version 2.2.4 is still available, this should work 
# (you might need to enter the root password).
#
# 2) 
# Replace/add some files:
cp MemoryOptimization.cpp $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/UserInterfaces/
cp SecondoPL.cpp $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/UserInterfaces/
cp makefile $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/UserInterfaces/
cp MemoryOptimization.h $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/include/

# 3)
# The steps described in $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Optimizer/NestedRelations/README 
# need to be done, too.

# 4)
# The last step is now to recompile secondo:
cd $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR
make

# eof
