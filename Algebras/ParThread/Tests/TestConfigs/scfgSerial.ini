# This is an example file. copy or rename it to SecondoConfig.ini

# e.g.: export SECONDO_PARAM_SecondoHome="/tmp/databases"

[Environment]
# Home directory of Secondo database, in fact the place where the Berkeley DB will
# store all record files used by Secondo. Note: By default, the directory /home/secondo-databases
# is used for the Berkeley DB files. A directory different from this will be used iff it is
# specified below AND it exists!
# Note: On windows you need absolute path names, e.g.
# C:\msys\1.0\home\user\secondo-dbtest
SecondoHome=$(HOME)/secondo-databases

# Algebralevel after startup (Executable|Descriptive|Hybrid).
AlgebraLevel=Executable

# Name prefix of the local socket used by the registar process. The

# Runtime Flags (refer to class RTFlags). This key can be used to define
# a comma separated list of runtime flags which switch on some special messages
# (for debugging or profiling) or some features like creating binary
# list formats for CS-communication. Please document new flags otherwise
# this mechanism is not useful. Note: a += assignment will extend the list.
# It is also possible to change flags interactively by typing
#
# (set "<KeyName>" = TRUE | FALSE)
#
# at the SECONDO command prompt.
