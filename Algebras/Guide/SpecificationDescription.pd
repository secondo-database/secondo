1 Description of the Specification file

Within the ~spec~ file, the syntax of operators is fixed.
The file must be located in the algebra directory and is name
~AlgebraName.spec~. The default syntax of an operator is
a prefix operator. Nevertheless it is recommended, to specify 
the syntax for all operators. 

If an operator occurs in several algebras, the syntax of the operator
must be the same. If not, the compilation process of Secondo
(make in Secondo's main directory) will fail with an appropriate 
error message.

Lines in the file starting with a '\#' are ignored and can be used for comments.
For formatting the file, empty lines are also ignored.

The syntax definition an an operator has format

----
operator <opname> alias <opalias> pattern <syntax> 
         [<implicit parameters>]

----

with

  * opname : Name of the operator

  * opalias: Name of the operator as text

  * syntax: syntax of the operator

  * implicit parameters: use of special types for function arguments


The implicit parameter part is optionally and can only used for function
arguments. The opalias is the name of the operator as text, e.g. PLUS
if the operator is '+'. This has technical reasons.

The syntax can be in format:

----

 op()           prefix operator without argument
 op(_)          prefix operator with one argument
 op(_,_)        prefix operator having arbitrary many arguments
 _ infixop _    infix operator
 _ op           postfix operator with one argument
 _ _ op         postfix operator having two arguments
 ...
 _ op [<paralist>] postfix operator having one argument before the
                   operator and some additional arguments within the
                   square brackets
_ _ op [<paralist>] postfix operator having two arguments before the
                    operator and additional arguments within the+
                    square brackets 
....

----

The parameter list within the square brackets can have the following values.

----
_, _     usual parameter
list     parameter list of arbitrary length
fun      this parameter is a function (together with implicit parameters)
funlist  list of functions
X ; Y    semicolon separated argument lists X and X are again parameter lists

----

Implicit parameter can be used for simpler use of function arguments. This required
a fun or a funlist to be part of the parameter list. The syntax is:

----

  implicit parameter <namelist> type <typelist>

----

where namelist is a list of comma separated names and type list are the corresponding
types. The first name is assigned to the first type, second name to the second type
and so on. This requires that both lists must have the same length. Often, the type is
given as so-called Type Operator. This is an operator having only the type mapping but 
no value mapping. Look at the example:

----
operator filter alias FILTER pattern _ op [ fun ]
     implicit parameter streamelem type STREAMELEM

----

The ~filter~ operator gets a stream of elements together with a function mapping
from the elements type to bool. All elements fullfilling the condition given by
this function are filtered out.

By the definition of implicit parameters, a query using the filter operator
can be easely written down. Assume a relation with scheme:

----
 zipcodes(Name : string, Zipcode : int)

----

a query for finding all elements of this relation having a zipcode smaller than
2000 can be found using:

----
 query zipcodes feed filter[.ZipCode < 2000] consume

----

By the implicit parameter part, this query is rewritten automatically to:

----

  query zipcodes feed 
        filter[ fun (streamelem : STREAMELEM) attr(e,ZipCode) < 2000 ] 
        consume

----

The type operator STREAMELEM extract the tuple type from the arounding types.
Thus, without all these mechanisms the query have to be written as

----

  query zipcodes feed
        filter[ fun( t : tuple([Name : string, Zipcode : int])) attr(t,ZipCode) < 2000 ]
        consume

----

Obviously, the first version using all features the the simplest one from the view of a
user.
