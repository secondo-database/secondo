1 Advanced Tests

The Selftest provides only simple tests. Only queries are allowed within 
an ~examples~ file, hence only objects within the stored database or
constant values can be used. 
Secondo provides a more powerful test suite for testing an algebra modul, the
~TestRunner~. A TestRunner file consists of three parts: the ~setup~ part, followed by
the ~test~ part and the final ~teardown~ part. Within the setup part, a database can be 
created, restored or just opened, new objects can be stored and so on. 
If one of the commands in the setup part fails, the complete test fails.
In the testcase part, commands and their results are specified. Besides a concrete 
result, the result can also indicate the success or failure of a command. Wheras the
success is required for let commands and similar, the failure case can be used to check 
the system for wrong inputs, e.g. checking type mappings.

An example TestRunner file including descriptions of the file format is the
~example.test~ file located in Secondo's ~bin~ directory.

For using a ~TestRunner~ file, enter:

----
TestRunner -i <filename>
----
within Secondo's ~bin~ directory. As usual, if valgrind is part of your system, the
following commands can be used for finding memory errors and leaks:

----
TestRunner --valgrind -i <filename>
TestRunner --valgrindlc -i <filename>
----
