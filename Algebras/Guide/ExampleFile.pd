1 The example file

\label{ExampleFile}

The example file provides at least one query for each operator. 
If an operator is omitted in this file, the operator is disabled
by the secondo framework. The file is used for automatic tests 
(Selftest). For a manual start of this test, just enter

----
Selftest tmp/<AlgebraName>.examples

----

within Secondo's ~bin~ directory. For memory error or memory leak
checking, use the command:

----
Selftest  --valgrind tmp/<AlgebraName>.examples

----

or

----
Selftest  --valgrindlc tmp/<AlgebraName>.examples

----

for more memory leak information.


The format of the file is quite easy. It starts with some general settings 
followed by examples for the operators. The general settings are:

----
Sequential: No
Database: berlintest
Restore : No

----

If ~Sequential~ is set to ~Yes~, the examples are executed in the order given in the
file. If it is set to ~No~ or this line is omitted, the operators are tested in lexicographical
order using the number as secondary sorting criterion.

The ~Database~ line specifies the database which is used for testing, here ~berlintest~.
If the test starts and the database is not already part of the system, the database is
restored from a file having the same name as the database in the ~bin~ directory. If also the
file is missing, the Selftest will fail.

If  ~Restore~ is set to ~Yes~, the database is freshly restored even if the database
already exists in the system. This is required, if within the algebra update operators are defined, manipulating
the content of the database. This ensures to start from a well defined database state.

After these general settings, for each operator must be given at least one example. The format is:

----
Operator  : <opname> 
Number    : <number>
Signature : <signature>
Example   : <query> 
Result    : <result>
Tolerance : <tolerance> 

----

~opname~ is the name of the operator. For the operator may also given an alias using 
~alias $<$ALIAS$>$~ directly after the operator's name. This may be required for
storing results in a file (see below).

~number~ is a counter starting from 1. If Sequential is set to
~Yes~, the counter is increased for each example. If Sequential is ~No~, the counting starts by
1 for each new operator and is increased if there are more examples for a single operator.

The signature line describes the signature of the operator in a textual way. If for each 
signature supported by the operator an example is given, this line can be restricted to
the signature used in the query. If only one example is given for an entire overloaded operator,
the description must handle all possible signatures in a general way.

The ~query~ part is a query using the operator, constant values and/or objects defined within the
used database.

~result~ specifies the result of the example query. If the result has a simple type (int, real, bool, string),
it can be given in short  form, e.g. 1, TRUE, or ''secondo''. Otherwise, the result is specified as nested list
including the type, e.g. (int 1), (bool TRUE), (string ''secondo''). Sometimes, the result depends on the
underlying operating system. For example, the number of nodes of an r-tree depends on the page size of the
system. To give a result for different operating systems, the result is specified in format:

----
  (platform (os1 result1) (os2 result2) ...)

---- 

where $os_i$ is one out of \{linux, linux64, win32, mac\_osx\}.


If the result is too large for writing it directly, the keyword ~file~ can be used instead of the result. In this case, the
result must be stored in a file called \\
~result$<$number$>$\_$<$opname$>$\_$<$AlgebraName$>$~ or \\
~result$<$number$>$\_$<$opname$>$\_$<$AlgebraName$>$\_$<$operating\_system$>$~ \\ in case of operating system
depending results. If the operator's name is not allowed to appear within a file name, the alias 
of the operator is used within the file name (see above).


The ~Tolerance~ is an optional value which is used to compare the results. If ~Tolerance~ is specified,
the result list and the computed result of a query are compared using an approximative comparison for 
double values. The tolerance can be given as an absolute value, e.g. 0.01 if a deviance between the two
values should not be greater than 0.01, or as an relative value, e.g. 0.1\% is the accepted tolerance is 0.1 percent.

The ~GuideAlgebra~ contains the following examples:
