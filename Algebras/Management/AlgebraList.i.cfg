1 List of Algebra Modules for Secondo

This file contains a list of all currently available algebra modules.

The macros ~ALGEBRA\_INCLUDE~ and ~ALGEBRA\_EXCLUDE~ allow to include
or exclude an algebra to or from the set of loaded algebra modules. They
are created by make (see 4.). Here you have just to define a unique name
and id for an algebra.

These macros have three parameters:

  *1 ~the unique identification number~ which must be a positive integer,
it is recommended but not absolutely necessary to order the entries of the
list in ascending order. No identification number may occur more than once
in the list. The maximum id is bounded by a constant MAX\_ALG.

  *2 The initialization function: This must match the pattern "Initialize<AlgebraName>"
in the list below only <AlgebraName> needs to be configured. If there are spell
or uppercase/lowercase errors this will result in a linker failure. The <AlgebraName> token should only be formed by letters since numbers in there may cause problems.


  *3 The active algebras are configured in the file makefile.algebras. A shell script
extracts the identification number and the level by the Algebra name. Therefore no
algebra initialization function name is allowed to appear twice, even if the line
starts with a c++ comment
