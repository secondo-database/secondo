May 2009, Sven Jungnickel. Initial version

November 2009, Sven Jungnickel. Changed default value for
default fan-in merge phase to experimentally determined
value of 65.

implement the new sort algorithm for operators ~sort2~ and ~sortby2~
and their parameter driven versions ~sort2Param~ and ~sortby2Param~.

/*
9 Class ~SortAlgorithm~

This class implements an algorithm for external sorting for operators
~sort2~, ~sortby2~, ~sort2Param~ and ~sortby2Param~. The constructor
creates sorted partitions of the input stream and stores them inside
temporary tuple files and two minimum heaps in memory. By calls of
~NextResultTuple~ tuples are returned in sorted order. The sort order
must be specified in the constructor. The memory usage is bounded,
hence only a fixed number of tuples can be hold in memory.

The algorithm roughly works as follows: First all input tuples are stored in a
minimum heap until no more tuples fit into memory. Then, a new tuple file is
created and the minimum is stored there. Afterwards, the tuples are handled as
follows:

(a) if the next tuple is less or equal than the minimum of the heap and greater
or equal than the last tuple written to disk, it will be appended to the
current file

(b) if the next tuple is smaller than the last written it will be stored in a
second heap to be used in the next created relation.

(c) if the next tuple t is greater than the top of the heap, the minimum will be
written to disk and t will be inserted into the heap.

Finally, the minimum tuple of every run is inserted into a probably small
heap (containing only one tuple for every partition) and for every request
for tuples this minimum is removed and the next tuple of the partition
of the just returned tuples will be inserted into the heap.

This algorithm reduces the number of comparisons which are quite costly inside
Secondo (due to usage of C++ Polymorphism) even for ~standard~ attributes.

Moreover, if the input stream is already sorted only one partition will be
created and no costs for merging tuples will occur. Unfortunateley this solution
needs more comparisons than sorting.

tuple comparisons the algorithm uses the compare object ~cmpObj~. All
progress information will be stored in ~p~. Additionally the constructor
allows to specify the maximum number of open temporary files during a merge
phase, the so called maximum fan-in ~maxFanIn~. If ~maxFanIn~ is set to
UINT\_MAX the sort algorithm uses the default value
SORT\_DEFAULT\_MAX\_FAN\_IN. The main memory that the operator uses can be
specified by parameter ~maxMemSize~. If ~maxMemSize~

arguments besides the stream. ~sortby2~ has a nested list of sort order
arguments as second argument. The template parameter ~param~ is used
to specify whether the operator receives three additional arguments. The
first one is the operators main memory size in KBytes, the second
one the maximum fan-in for a merge phase and the third one the I/O
buffer size for read/write operations to disc. ~param~ is set to true
for operators ~sort2Param~ and ~sortby2Param~.
