To use the MovingRegion3Algebra, the Region2Algebra has to be activated, too.
The use of the MovingRegion2Algebra together with the MovingRegion3Algebra/Region2Algebra is not possible!

The MovingRegion3Algebra/Region2Algebra uses the GMP-library, so the following needs to be done:
In the file makefile.optimizer the option -lgmpxx has to be added at line 67: -lgmpxx

LD_GMP := -lgmpxx -lgmp

or use the switch in the makefile.algebras file:

ALGEBRA_DIRS += Region2
ALGEBRAS     += Region2Algebra
ALGEBRA_DEPS += gmpxx gmp

ALGEBRA_DIRS += MovingRegion3
ALGEBRAS     += MovingRegion3Algebra
ALGEBRA_DEPS += gmpxx gmp
