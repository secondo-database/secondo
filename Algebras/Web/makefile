# SECONDO makefile for Web Algebra C++
#
########################################################################

# 30.11.2004, M. Spiekermann. Reorganization of the makefiles at the algbra
#             level. This is a documented makefile which should explain the
#             basic structure.

# include global definitions
include ../../makefile.env

# This is the only macro which must be changed in order to
# define a module name for an algebra. The rest of this makefile
# should work for nearly every algebra.
MODNAME = WEBAlgebra

# Use the mace CCFLAGS to add special compiler flags if needed.
# In this case the defaults are sufficient
CCFLAGS += $(DEFAULTCCFLAGS) 

# expand compile flags if necessary
CCFLAGS += -Werror 

# The next rule will create a ".o" file for every ".cpp" file and
# creates a "lib$(MODNAME).a" file in the secondo/lib dir. Rules
# for creating ".dep" files and ".o" files are defined in makefile.env
.PHONY: all
all: $(OBJECTS) $(LIBOBJ)

WebFlex.cc: web.l web.h
	$(LEX) -+ -oWebFlex.cc web.l

WebFlex.o: WebFlex.cc

# DEP_FILES is a macro defined in makefile.env. It will contain
# a list of files which are generated by the compiler to
# detect dependencies to other code files.

# The rule below creates a library file. Maybe as shared or as static
# object. In case of a shared object all dependencies to other libraries
# must be defined. However, currently the command make shared=yes will
# not work. But in principle every algebra implementor has to define dependencies
# to other libraries here, since the make procedure does not know how to do this
# automatically.
