[1] Abstract

Midi is a standardized format to provide a way of interchanging time-stamped MIDI data between different programs on the same or different computers. One of the primary design goals was compact representation, which makes it very appropriate for disk-based file format, but less appropriate for quick access by a sequencer program.

This MidiAlgebra introduces Midi files to SECONDO. It is completely integrated into the persistency mechanism of SECONDO. Therefore you can store Midi files inside relations as well as use Midi objects as results of SECONDO queries. We are providing several operators to extract information from Midi files or to create new Midi files depending on the users desire.

The also available MidiViewer is a java-based Viewer using a graphical interface with comparable functionality to SECONDO. The big advantage of the Viewer beyond SECONDO is the opportunity to play Midi files and use additional features e.g. easily mute single tracks of a Midi. There you can also check the results you did to a Midi file using the inside SECONDO implemented operators.

[1] Introduction

MIDI means *M*usical*I*nstrument*D*igital*I*nterface\footnote{www.midi.org} and is a standardized format to provide a way of interchanging time-stamped MIDI data between different programs on the same or different computers. It was originally designed by a group of manufacturers of electronical instruments ( MMA - Midi Manufacturer Association ) to connect their products to each other. Until then every manufacturer had designed their own languages. The created music was only usable on this only product and could not played on electronical instruments from other manufacturers.

A MIDI is not really music. It consists of all information necessary to *produce* music on electronical instruments. That means you have control information which can be converted by these intruments into hearable music. Finally no vocals are available.

Normally a MIDI consists of a header, some tracks and a lot of events. All these information are sequentielly organised inside a file. The header includes some basic information like format and number of tracks. Every tracks stores a variable number of single events. There are 3 different kinds of events existing. ~MidiEvents~ for music control, ~MetaEvents~ for general information and ~SystemEvents~ for system control. Sometimes you will find the expression message instead of event but both means the same.

        The ~MidiEvents~ stores the control about e.g. notes ( on / off ), program or control changes and pitch wheel changes. These information is only valid for a specific note at a fixed position inside a track.

        The ~MetaEvents~ stores general information about the song stored inside the Midi file. They provides i.e. copyright data, instrument names, the song lyrics and so on. You see, all these data are valid for the whole Midi file or at least for a specific track.

        The ~SystemEvents~ includes global song messages like start, stop, continue and so on.

Midi is a standardized format to provide a way of interchanging time-stamped MIDI data between different programs on the same or different computers. One of the primary design goals was compact representation, which makes it very appropriate for disk-based file format, but less appropriate for quick access by a sequencer program.

This MidiAlgebra introduces Midi files to SECONDO. It is completely integrated into the persistency mechanism of SECONDO. Therefore you can store Midi files inside relations as well as use Midi objects as results of SECONDO queries. We are providing several operators to extract information from Midi files or to create new Midi files depending on the users desire.

The also available MidiViewer is a java-based Viewer using a graphical interface with comparable functionality to SECONDO. The big advantage of the Viewer beyond SECONDO is the opportunity to play Midi files and use additional features e.g. easily mute single tracks of a Midi. There you can also check the results you did to a Midi file using the inside SECONDO implemented operators.

At the moment the MidiAlgebra supports only Midi files with format 1, because only a few Midi files are created using the other two formats. You need not to care about this issue, because all formats can be read and stored. But not all operators are released for using all possible formats.

1 Implementation of the Midi Algebra

This Algebra provides support for the MIDI music format inside SECONDO.
MIDI songs are using the binary interface via BASE64 coding. Several operators
are available to manipulate tracks, search for content and so on. For more
detailed information look inside the header file. A list containing all
operators you can easily find inside the SPEC file. Detailed information
concerning the operators you can find beside the implementation of each
operator.

The class design follows not directly the hierachical structure of a Midi file. Normally you will create a class ~Midi~ storing references to the included tracks. This class ~track~ would store the references to all included events. Later you would design inherited classes ( from ~Event~ ) for ~MidiEvent~, ~MetaEvent~ and ~SystemEvent~. Due to the restrictions of SECONDO you cannot work with references.

The used design is completely different.

The main class is ~Midi~. It is the only persistent class. ~Midi~ includes infomation about all used types. That means that this class stores information about ~tracks~, ~events~ and ~eventData~ inside separated DBArrays. By that were are able to store Midi files into SECONDO.

The also used classes ~Track~ and ~Event~ are only transient. They are not inherited from ~StandardAttribute~. We use them to follow the object-oriented approach. ~Track~ ( for events ) and ~Event~ ( for event data ) includes their own structures for holding data. These structures are filled on the fly e.g. running SECONDO operators.

/*
2.1 Utility functions used by infunction

The interaction between these functions works as follows:

The function ~InMidi~ constructs a Midi object with zero ticks and the
standard header. It takes the coded text representing the whole Midi file
and transforms it into a c++ string. Then it calls the ~InHeader~ function
with both Midi and string as parameters.

~InHeader~ puts the string into an stringstream and reads out all header
informations of the Midi file. Syntactical correctness is tested and
then all header informations are put in the Midi object.

Then ~InTracks~ is called with the Midi ( in construction ), the stream
( without header) and the number of tracks as parameters. ~InTracks~
realizes a loop over the number of tracks , counts the bytelength of
every track and reads the bytes according to one track out of the stream.

The track header information are read, checked and a Track object is
constructed and filled with Events ( which are in the current streampart )
by the ~InEvents~ function.

~InEvents~ reads out the stream event by event as long as the tracklength
allows. At first deltatime and the event type characterizing bytes are
read and than the corresponding Event object is constructed. For every
Event type there is a function ( ~InMetaEvent~, ~InSystemmessage~, ...) which
checks the syntax of this Event ( also some context checks are done ) and the
information of these events are put into corresponding structures. Then the
events are appended to the current track.

Given back this track to ~InTracks~ the
information of the whole track are put into the Midi object structures
( DBArrays ) by function ~AppendTrack~. Because these structures are
independend from track objects the track objects have to be deleted after
appending them.

Note that all deviation from Midi Standard found out in syntax or context
checks causes error messages and avoid constructing a Midi object. This
can lead to the situation that a  Midi is playable in usual Midiplayer
program but not loadable into SECONDO. This decision follows our
intention concerning consistence and uniqueness of database objects.

searched for. With the 3 flags you can specify the search for different kind
of Text - the same way like in extract\_lyrics operators. True will be returned
if the search was succesfull, false if not.

4.3 Operator ~contains\_sequence~

This operator examines a track of an existing Midi object and looks for
a specified sequence of notes if it is included. The searched notes are
passed by a string in the syntax below.

$<input\_list> := <note>,<note\_list>$

$<note\_list>  := <note> | <note>,<note\_list>$

$<note>        := <note\_char><note\_No> |
<note\_char><flat\_sharp\_ident><note\_No>$

$<note\_No>    := -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9$

$<flat\_sharp\_ident> := b | \#$

The next argument allows transposing. If is set TRUE, the input list of
notes will be interpreted as a sequence of halftone steps.
The first occurrence of the sequence will be found. The last argument
specifies the to be examined track. A searching for a sequence with
this operator is only useful in tracks with a monophonic voice.

Operator ~contains\_sequence~ accepts a Midi object, the string with
the searched notes, a boolean value for allowed transposition and an
integer value representing the to be examined track.

1 Implementation of MidiFile

This class provides a design to represent Midi objects in java. As the
MidiViewer handles only one sequencer, the current implementation of
MidiFile is some sort of a ~lightweight~ object design. In fact, only the
sequence and some (generated) meta informations are part of a
MidiFile object.
