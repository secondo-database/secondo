[1] Picture Algebra: Class Definitions

'Extensible Database Systems' at Fernuniversit[ae]t Hagen.

1 Introduction

The Picture algebra for SECONDO provides operations to store and
manipulate images in JPEG format. It consists of two data types. A ~picture~
object represents a single JPEG image and allows to scale, cut, mirror, rotate
and compare images. ~histogram~ represents the histogram of a ~picture~ object
and is created from a ~picture~ object.

The implementation of the Picture algebra is spread over multiple modules,
both to structure the code in a useful way and to enable the team to work
in parallel without causing frequent conflicts.

  * ~PictureAlgebra.h~ (this file): Contains class definitions.

  * ~PictureAlgebra\_base.cpp~: Contains all code related to creating
    the Picture algebra itself. Code relating to the implementation of
    SECONDO types ~picture~ and ~histogram~ are located in other modules, as
    shown below.

  * ~PictureAlgebra\_pictimp.cpp~: All methods required for ~Picture~
    to represent a SECONDO ~picture~ object plus functions required by
    SECONDO to use ~Picture~ plus basic SECONDO operators on ~picture~.

  * ~PictureAlgebra\_attrops.cpp~: SECONDO operators on ~picture~, which
    deal with basic attributes such as image heigh or width.

  * ~PictureAlgebra\_graphops.cpp~: SECONDO operators on ~picture~, which
    perform graphical operations such as scaling an image.

  * ~PictureAlgebra\_histimp.cpp~: All methods required for
    ~Histogram~ to represent a SECONDO ~histogram~ object plus functions.
    required by SECONDO to use ~Histogram~.

  * ~PictureAlgebra\_histops.cpp~: SECONDO operators on ~picture~, which
    implicitely use ~histogram~.

  * ~JPEGPicture.cpp~: The class ~JPEGPicture~ is used to compress and
    decompress JPEG images and to examine specific JPEG image attributes.

  * ~JPEGMemManager.cpp~: ~libjpeg~ memory manager, as required by
    ~JPEGPicture.cpp~.

2 General definitions

If ~PA\_DEBUG~ is set to ~true~, verbose debug output is generated. If you
are running SECONDO in client/server mode, note that the output is shown in
the server.

~PROG\_DISPLAY~ is the command used by the ~display~ operator to display
JPEG images. We suggest to use the ~display~ program from ImageMagick.

4 Class ~Picture~

As the class ~Picture~ implements ~Attribute~, ~picture~ objects
can be used in relations.

*/

class Picture : public Attribute {

/*

4.1 Private attributes

The attributes ~filename~, ~category~, ~date~ and ~isPortrait~ contain the
filename, the category, the creation data and a flag for the orientation of
the image. These attributes do not have an specific sementic in the Picture
algebra but are just used to store application data.

As SECONDO does not provide means to store dynamically allocated memory
segments without using FLOBs, all string attributes are defined as ~STRING~,
which is an array of 48+1 characters, ie. this array has exactly the size
of the maximum length of a SECONDO string.

Attribute ~date~ contains the image's date in the string representation of the
DateTime algebra.

~isDefined~ is used to represent undefined SECONDO ~picture~ objects.

~jpegData~ is used to store the binary JPEG data of the image in SECONDO.

The four histograms in attribute ~histogram~ (for red, green, blue and
luminance) are created during object construction. Main reason is the
graphical representation of histograms: If multiple histograms are displayed
in one graph, the maximum value of each histogram must be known for proper
scaling of the Y axis. As the histogram viewer receives a single
histogram during each call only and cannot access the other histograms, each
histogram needs to contain an attribute specifying the maximum value, which
can be used by the viewer. As all four histograms of a ~Picture~ object are
generated during object creating, the maximum value can be set for all four
objects too. Moreover, calculating the histograms during object creation
is efficient, because ~Histogram~ objects are small and not to be generated
only once even if used multiple times.

data is explicitely allocated during this call. Once you have completed
working with the data, you have to free the allocated memory to avoid
memory leaks. As the image data is stored in a FLOB, there is no more
efficient way to implement this method. ~size~ will be set to the total size
