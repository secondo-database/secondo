1 Header File: Socket I/O

February 2002 Ulrich Telle

1.1 Overview

TCP (Transaction Control Protocol) is one of the most common protocols
on the Internet. It has two basic communicators: clients and servers.
Servers offer services to the network; clients connect to these services
through ports. Sockets are the basis of network communication. Client
software uses sockets to connect to servers. Servers use sockets to
process network connections. TCP sockets provide very reliable connections
using a special open communication flow similar to low-level stream I/O.

Implementing clients and servers are fairly straightforward. Servers build
a socket for listening on a port for incoming client connect requests.
Clients also build a socket, connect to the server socket and then exchange
messages.

The set of classes defined here supports a subset of the TCP/IP protocol
suite. Currently only IP version 4 is supported, but support for IP version
6 could be incorporated.

Implementations of sockets are mostly based on socket libraries provided
by the operating system. Local domain sockets are directly supported only
in Unix. For 32-bit-Windows this socket module provides a very efficient
implementation of local sockets using shared memory and semaphore objects.
This allows very fast inter-process communication on one computer.

*NOTE*: Different operating systems require different initialization and
deinitialization of the socket interface. This is done transparently by
instantiating a static instance of an internal class hidden in the
implementation. The constructor is called before the main function is
entered, thereby ensuring that the operating systems's socket interfaces
is properly installed. The destructor is called on normal termination of
the program.

1.3 Interface methods

The class ~Socket~ is the heart of this module. Network communication
is done by using methods of this class. Additionally to creating and
destroying sockets, reading and writing on these sockets there are
methods to identify the client and the server thus allowing a basic
form of authentication and access control through the classes
~SocketRule~ and ~SocketRuleSet~. It is possible to specify a list of
rules where each rule consists of an IP address, an IP address mask
and an access policy allowing or denying access. When an IP address
is checked against a set of rules, for each rule a bitwise *and*
operation is performed on the given IP address and the IP address
mask of a rule. The result is compared with the IP address of the rule.
If the result matches, the decision whether access should be allowed
or denied is based on the access policy of the rule and the default
access policy of the rule set. Finally, the class ~SocketAddress~
hides details of the internet addresses from the user.

The class ~Socket~ provides the following methods:

[23]    Creation/Removal & Input/Output    & Information          \\
        [--------]
        Socket           & Read            & IsLibraryInitialized \\
        [tilde]Socket    & Write           & IsOk                 \\
        CreateLocal      & GetSocketStream & GetErrorText         \\
        CreateGlobal     &                 & GetSocketAddress     \\
        Accept           & CancelAccept    & GetPeerAddress       \\
        CreateClient     & Close           & GetHostname          \\
        Connect          & ShutDown        & GetIP                \\
        GetDescriptor    &                 &                      \\

The class ~SocketRule~ provides the following methods:

[23]    Creation/Removal  & Checking & I/O settings \\
        [--------]
        SocketRule        & Match    & SetDelimiter \\
        [tilde]SocketRule & Allowed  & GetDelimiter \\
                          & Denied   &              \\

The class ~SocketRuleSet~ provides the following methods:

[23]    Creation/Removal     & Checking & Persistence \\
        [--------]
        SocketRuleSet        & AddRule  & LoadFromFile \\
        [tilde]SocketRuleSet & Ok       & StoreToFile \\

The class ~SocketAddress~ provides the following methods:

[22]    Creation/Removal     & Address handling \\
        [--------]
        SocketAddress        & SetAddress       \\
        [tilde]SocketAddress & GetSocketString  \\
        operator=            & GetIPAddress     \\
                             & GetPort          \\
                             & operator==       \\

The class ~SocketBuffer~ implements the *streambuf* interface of the
C++ standard library for socket streams. This greatly simplifies
reading and writing to and from sockets. Since this class is used
internally only, the class interface is not described here.

1.2 UDP-Sockets

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless transmission network protocol.
Its advantage is, that it is faster than TCP. Its disadvantage is, that there is
no guarantee of correctness, corect ordering or reliabilty of deliverance of
data sent.

Instead of sending data streams between two connected sockets, UDP allows to
send ~datagrams~ to remote sockets and receive such data.

Initialization and finalization is already done by the TCP/IP part in this file.
