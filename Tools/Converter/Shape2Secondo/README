If you want to convert shape-files into a Secondo readable format,
perform the following steps.

- Compile Secondo's Javagui
- Copy all *.shp and *.db3 files to convert into an empty directory
- If the files are zipped, unzip them
- call the following command:
	java -Xmx 512m -classpath $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Javagui tools.xxx2secdb <dbname> *.shp
- The result will be a file named <dbname> which contains a database with all
converted shape-files.

- If you have problems with memory (Java.OutOfMemory Exception), switch the
Nested List to the persistent version by doing the following steps:

- go into the Javagui directory
- change the entry  "NL_PERSISTENT=false" to "NL_PERSISTENT=true" in the file 
  makefile.inc
- Recompile Javagui using make.
