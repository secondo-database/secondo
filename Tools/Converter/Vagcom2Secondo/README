Introduction
============


This converter can convert LOG files produced by the software VAG.COM version 3.11-2.
The software can be downloaded as shareware from:
   http://www.ross-tech.com/

A log file consists of a header and data lines in csv format. The converter analyses 
the header and produces a relation consisting of a single tuple. The attributes depend
on the logged data. For each measured value, four attributes are created in the relation.
These are the name, the range and the measure unit of this value as string type and a
moving real representing the values.


Compiling the converter
=======================

To compile the converter, go into the Javagui directory and run make.
After that, go into the converter directory an run make again.
Ensure to have set the SECONDO_BUILD_DIR environment varaible correctly.


Running the converter
=====================

The best way to run the converter is to use the convert script. 
Ensure to have set the SECONDO_BUILD_DIR variable correctly. After that,
type in:
    convert <filename> [-o <output file>] [-n <object name>]

The filename is the log file which should be converted. 
Using the -o option, the output file can be specified. If this option is omitted,
the output is written to the console. 
If the -n option is used, the output is created in SECONDO's object format with the
given name. Such files can restored in SECONDO directly. Without this option, the
file format is given by ( <type> <value> ). Such files can be read from the Javagui.
