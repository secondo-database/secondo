2 createTextRelation

This script creates a SECONDO object. It's a relation with the following schema
   (rel (tuple ( (filename text) (pdf text) (theText text))))
The pdf attribute is embedded in a  <file> tag so that the parser of secondo
loads the content of this file as base64 coded text atom. The text contained in
this pdf is put into the text attribute using the pdftotext tool. 
pdftotext is part of the xpdf project. You can download it from 
    http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html

The script needs the name of the object as the only argument. Then, it waits 
for inputs which have to be filenames of pdf documents. After entering a blank
line, the script will stop its output. You can use the script in a pipe, e.g.
  find -name "*.pdf" | createPdfRelation MyPdfFiles > MyPdfFilesobj




3 createTextRelation

2.1 Standard Use

The script createTextRelation stores a set of files into a relation
of the following type: 
   ( rel (tuple ((filename text)(theText text)))) 

The script requires one single argument indicating the name of the 
created object. It reads filenames from the standardinput and writes 
for each input a tuple to the standard output. The input ends with a 
blank line.

If you want to use this tools frequently, add the path to this script 
into your PATH variable or create an alias for this script:
alias createTextRelation="$SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Tools/Generators/TextRelations/createTextRelation"


Combined with the standard tools, you can use this script to collect 
all files with wanted properties into a single relation.

Example 1:
You want to collect all text files directly located in your $HOME/Documents 
directory. The call is:

ls $HOME/Documents/*.txt | createTextRelation MyDocuments > MyDocumentsObj

Example 2:
Collecting all html files in your home directory or subdirectories of it.
The call is:

find $HOME -iname "*.html" | createTextRelation MyWebpages > MyWebpagesObj


3. Changing the script for special purposes

Binary data are frequently stored in textatoms. You can change the script for handling
such data. To do this, you have just to change the three variables CONTENTTYPE, 
CONTENT, and CONTENTNAME in the script. 

The CONTENTTYPE is the name of the attribute type e.g. text, binfile, or jpg.
Some objects are stored as base 64 coded textatoms. The nested list parser 
provides a <file> tag for automatically coding a file into such an text. 
Set the variable CONTENT to 'file' if your type uses base64 encoding. 
Note, that the coding is maked by the nested list parser, not by this script.
For this reason use absolute pathnames for this script e.g.
use
  find $PWD -name "*.jpg" | createTextRelation MyPictures > MyPicturesObj
instead of
  find -name "*.jpg" | createTextRelation MyPictures > MyPicturesObj

Whith the variable CONTENTNAME you can control the attributename of the  filecontent.
