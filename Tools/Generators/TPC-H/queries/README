This directory contains the current set of funtional query
definition templates. They are derived from the functional query
definitions presented in Clause 2 of the TPC-H and TPC-R Benchmark 
Specifications and should allow the use of QGEN (see ../dbgen).  
The template for query nn is stored in nn.sql.

Refer to Clause 2.2 for the permissible use of these templates.

Files ending with ".pg" are translated to Postgres SQL syntax 
and the files tpcX contain a query plan produced by SECONDOs 
optimizer whereas the files tpcX_opt are hand tuned query plans.

The file tpcqueries.pl contains queries in a SQL like syntax suitable for
SECONDO's optimizer.
