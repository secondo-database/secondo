1 Introduction

This guide explains the installation procedure for Secondo on computers running
the Linux operating system. Secondo depends on some software and therefore we
provide some insights on how to install them too. 

This guide explains the installation procedure for various software packages
needed to set up an complete development environment ready to compile Secondo.
We have built the system on the following operating-systems: 

  * SuSe Linux: 8.1, 8.2, 9.0, 9.2, 10.1 

  * Mac-OSX: Tiger

Secondo's source code has the following dependencies:

[44] 
  Tool/Compiler  & Version & Homepage           & CD-Directory  \\
  [--------]
  bash           & 2.05b   & www.gnu.org        & extras/unix   \\
  make           & 3.79.1  & www.gnu.org        & extras/unix   \\
		 &         &                    &               \\
  texinfo        & 4.8     & www.gnu.org        & linux/gnu     \\
  gcc/c++        & 3.4.6   & gcc.gnu.org        & linux/gnu     \\
  bison          & 1.875   & www.gnu.org        & linux/gnu     \\
  lib readline   & 4.3     & www.gnu.org        & linux/gnu     \\

  findutils      & 4.2.28  & www.gnu.org        & linux/gnu     \\
		 &         &                    &               \\

  berkeley-db    & 4.2.52  & www.sleepycat.com  & linux/non-gnu \\
		 &         &                    &               \\
  swi-prolog     & 5.4.7   & www.swi-prolog.org & linux/prolog  \\
  java2 sdk      & 1.4.2   & www.javasoft.com   & linux/j2sdk   \\


On the Secondo homepage we have collected them into
Installation-Kits (Linux, Windows specific versions without Java2-SDK) and an
ISO image of a CD-ROM which contains all tools for both operating systems and
some databases. All tools with a GNU license can be found via www.gnu.org, there
is a link to the free software directory (http://directory.fsf.org). This is a
portal to all known free software. 

However, you can try to get the needed tools from the internet and set up your own
environment. To some extent it may also work with higher or smaller version
numbers as recommend above. But we cannot guarantee that it will work. The
version above is the setup for which we know that it works.  

We follow three approaches to install the required 3rd-party software (i) the
installation script, (ii) instructions for installing RPM-packages, (iii)
instructions for compiling the packages itself. 

The first one assumes that you download one of the Installation-Kits or that you
got a cd-rom. These provide a script "installsdk" which will uncompress, compile
and install the above tools with minimal user interaction below your "$HOME"[20]
directory. 

The second one is to use a Linux distribution package installer. Some people
will prefer this approach because the package installers normally check
dependencies between software.  Given that we are experienced on using SuSE and
linux, we provide installation instructions for both using the package
administration tool YaST. In fact we do not provide information on how to use
the YaST tool, but only the package names needed. To do this you need to use the
super user account ~root~. 

The third approach is to download the source code from their corresponding
websites, compile, and install them. With this approach, it is possible to
perform the installation steps as an ordinary user. 

Throughout this guide, we assume that the ~bash~ is used as shell and some base
software are already installed, e.g. ~tar~, a C compiler ~gcc~, and ~make~.

2 Running the script "installsdk"[23]

Download the installation kit of the secondo homepage and extract it

*/
  tar -xvzf <inst-kit>.tar.gz
/* 

Alternatively you may have got a CD which contains all the needed stuff. Then
copy it to your disk into a separate directory. Now go into the new created
directory and run the script, e.g.

*/
  cd <inst-kit-dir>
  ./installsdk
/*  

The script will create a subtree under "$HOME/secondo-sdk"[20] where it installs
all 3rd-party software. The compilation of packages is done below the "/tmp"
directory, the script will report the exact destination.

During the installation two child windows appear. The first contains the Java
installation which needs some user interaction, and the other displays the
messages of the compiler during installation. All tools will be installed into
the directory "$HOME/secondo-sdk". However, we can not guarantee, that the
script works on all available Linux versions, but we hope that it basically
works and helps to save time. 

If some steps fail, you may need to study the log file and correct the
installation of the failed packages by hand.

The most critical part of the installation is thath of the ~gcc~. The problem
is, that if the version of your system's gcc and the one to be installed is
highly different this may result in an compile error. If your system's compiler
is already higher, then the script will try to use it instead hoping that the
secondo-code does compile.

At the end, the script will create some shell scripts which basically set up a
lot of environment variables which are needed at compile time and runtime 
in your "$HOME"[20] directory, these are

*/
  .secondorc
  .secondo.aliases
  .secondo.linuxrc 
/*

These need to be changed if some tools are not
installed in their assumed default installation directory, e.g. JAVA2-SDK, if it
is already present. In order to execute the commands in the current instance of
the shell you need to run 

*/
  export SECONDO_PLATFORM=linux
  source ~/.secondorc
/*

You can also add this command in the file "[~]/.bashrc" which will be executed
automatically when a new shell is invoked. Moreover, the following commands
aliases are available: 

 * "secinit": Sets some environment variables to some default
              values (it simply executes "secondorc"). Afterwards your shell 
              environment will be altered and it should be possible to compile 
              and link Secondo.

  * "secenv": Displays the values of some important environment variables.

  * "secroot": Defines the current directory as root of a Secondo source tree 
               (changing variable "SECONDO_BUILD_DIR"). This is useful if you 
               have different source trees and need to change between them.



2 Installing the packages with YaST under SuSE Linux

Here is the list of all packages that must be installed. The search field inside
YaST can be used to filter packages by name. If a package is already installed,
just leave it marked.  If YaST presents other dependencies that are not provided
here, just let it install them.

Some packages, e.g. java and swi-prolog, are not provided in the standard
installation of SuSE, because they are not free software. One must use the
additional installation CD (or repository) in order to install such packages.



2.1 Package ~make~

*/
make

/*
2.2 Package ~tar~

*/
tar

/*
2.3 Package ~binutils~

*/
binutils

/*
2.4 Package ~gcc~ with support to C++

*/
gcc
libstdc++-devel
gcc-c++

/*
2.5 Package ~bison~

*/
bison

/*
2.6 Package ~flex~

*/
flex

/*
2.7 Package ~java~

*/
java-<version>-sun
jpackage-utils
update-alternatives
java-<version>-sun-devel

/*
2.8 Library ~jpeg~

*/
libjpeg
libjpeg-devel

/*
2.9 Library ~readline~

*/
readline
readline-devel

/*
2.10 Library ~ncurses~

*/
ncurses
ncurses-devel

/*
2.11 Package ~swi-prolog~ 

*/
gmp
gmp-devel
swi-prolog

/*
2.12 Package ~Berkeley DB~

*/
db
db-devel
db-utils

/*
Now proceed with the sections 4 and 5.

*/

/*
3 Compiling all the packages

In this approach, all software will be compiled and installed in the system. For
that, the tools tar, make, and gcc must be previously installed. One can check
if they are present in the system running the following commands:

*/
tar --version
make --version
gcc --version

/*

If one of them is not present, please contact the system administrator to
install them. In most Linux installations, these applications are already
available.

Depending on the the system, some of the packages needed are already installed.
One could first check whether they are installed before really installing them.
Skip the steps to install the packages that are already installed in your system.

In order to compile and install all the packages, we suggest to create a
directory in the user home directory called secondo-sdk, so that it is possible
to perform the installation steps as an ordinary user. If one has superuser
access and wants to put the software available for all users, another directory
can be used, e.g. "/usr/local" (see the --prefix argument in the configure step).
We also suggest the creation of a temporary installation directory called
secondo-install, which can be removed after the end of the process. We will also
create environmental variables to point to these two directories, namely
"SECONDO_SDK" and "SECONDO_INSTALL", respectively. Enter the following commands:

*/
cd $HOME
mkdir secondo-sdk
export SECONDO_SDK=$HOME/secondo-sdk
mkdir secondo-install
export SECONDO_INSTALL=$HOME/secondo-install

/*

Let us also add the ~bin~ directory of the secondo sdk to the PATH and the ~lib~
directory to the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH"[20]

*/
mkdir $SECONDO_SDK/bin
export PATH=$SECONDO_SDK/bin:$PATH
mkdir $SECONDO_SDK/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SECONDO_SDK/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

/*
Normally, compiling and installing software is done in four steps:

  * downloading the source and decompressing it,
 
  * calling the configure script to check system defaults and to set some options,

  * running "make", which compiles the sources, and

  * running "make install" to copy the files to their destination.

3.1 Building the C++ compiler

In some Linux systems, only the C compiler comes pre-installed but not the C++.
As said before, we are assuming that the C compiler is already installed. 

First, it is good to check it the C++ compiler is already installed in the
system. The following command will print information about it.

*/
g++ --version

/*

If the compiler is not installed, then we have to build it. Otherwise skip the
next sub-sections.  The only dependency for the C++ compiler is the ~texinfo~
package, which itself depends on the ~ncurses~ library.

3.1.1 Building the library ~ncurses~ without C++ support

At this point we do not have a C++ compiler, then we will build this package
without support for C++.

Download the file "ncurses<version>.tar.gz" into the 
secondo-install directory. Run the following set of commands.

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
tar zxvf ncurses<version>.tar.gz
cd ncurses<version>
./configure --prefix=$SECONDO_SDK --disable-nls --without-cxx-binding
make
make install

/*
3.1.2 Building the package ~texinfo~

We have found a problem while configuring the ~texinfo~ package that it seems not to
recognize the ~ncurses~ library. We then run this command in order to tell it where is
the ~ncurses~ library.

*/
export LDFLAGS="-L$SECONDO_SDK/lib -lncurses"

/*
Now we can build the ~texinfo~ package. Download it into the secondo-install
directory and run the following commands.

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
tar zxvf texinfo<version>.tar.gz
cd texinfo<version>
./configure --prefix=$SECONDO_SDK --disable-nls
make
make install

/*
3.1.3 Building the C++ compiler

Download the ~gcc~ package from gcc.gnu.org into the secondo-install directory
and execute the following commands

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
tar zxvf gcc<version>.tar.gz
mkdir gcc<version>.objs

/*

The ~gcc~ documentation strongly recomends that we create a directory for the
object files outside the directory tree of the ~gcc~.

*/
cd gcc<version>.objs
../gcc<version>/configure --prefix=$SECONDO_SDK --disable-nls --enable-bootstrap
make bootstrap
make install

/*
3.2 Building the library ~ncurses~

Even if you followed the procedure in Section 3.1.1, you have only created the
~ncurses~ library without support for C++. 

If you did not follow the procedure in Section 3.1.1, then download the library
~ncurses~ into the secondo-install directory,
and run the following set of commands.

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
tar zxvf ncurses<version>.tar.gz

/*
Now we can build the ~ncurses~ library with the commands:

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
cd ncurses<version>
./configure --prefix=$SECONDO_SDK --disable-nls --with-cxx-binding
make
make install

/*
3.3 Building the library ~readline~

Download the library into the
secondo-install directory and run the following commands:

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
tar zxvf readline<version>.tar.gz
cd readline<version>
./configure --prefix=$SECONDO_SDK --with-curses
make
make install

/*
3.4 Building the ~bison~ package

Download the package into the secondo-install
directory and run the following commands:

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
tar zxvf bison<version>.tar.gz
cd bison<version>
./configure --prefix=$SECONDO_SDK 
make
make install

/*
3.4 Building the ~flex~ package

Download the package into the secondo-install
directory and run the following commands:

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
tar zxvf flex<version>.tar.gz
cd flex<version>
./configure --prefix=$SECONDO_SDK
make
make install

/*
3.4 Building the ~jpeg~ library

One should note that the ~jpeg~ library is only necessary if the Picture Algebra
is used. Otherwise this section can be skipped.

Download the package  into the secondo-install directory
and run the following commands:

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
tar zxvf jpegsrc<version>.tar.gz
cd jpegsrc<version>
./configure --prefix=$SECONDO_SDK
make
make install
make install-lib

/*
3.5 Building the ~Berkeley DB~ package

Download the package into the secondo-install directory.
We suggest downloading the version without encription (the file name contains
"NC"), since Secondo does not use this feature.

Run the following commands:

*/
cd $SECONDO_INSTALL
tar zxvf db<version>.NC.tar.gz
cd db<version>.NC/build_unix
../dist/configure --prefix=$SECONDO_SDK --enable-cxx
make
make install

/*
3.6 Building the ~java~ package

This package cannot be built by compiling it, Since it is no free software (see
also www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html). One has to download an executable
file called "jdk<version>.bin" into the secondo-install directory and execute it
from the secondo-sdk directory as follows:

*/
cd $SECONDO_SDK
$SECONDO_INSTALL/jdk<version>.bin


/*
4 Environment Setup

Now we are able to setup environment variables that are needed to compile and
run Secondo. We suggest that a file called ".secondorc"[20] is created and all these
commands are added in this file. One can then put a call to this file in the
".bashrc" so that it will be called automatically after the user logs in. In the
".bashrc" file one can add the following line:

*/
source ~/.secondorc

/*
Here is an example of the ".secondorc" file for this installation.

*/
# The platform
export SECONDO_PLATFORM=linux

# The directory of the secondo sources
export SECONDO_BUILD_DIR=$HOME/secondo

# The root of a subtree where several 3rd party tools are installed
export SECONDO_SDK=$HOME/secondo-sdk

# The secondo configuration file
export SECONDO_CONFIG=$SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/bin/SecondoConfig.ini

# Berkeley DB
export BERKELEY_DB_DIR=$SECONDO_SDK

# SWI-Prolog
export PL_INCLUDE_DIR=$SECONDO_SDK/lib/pl-<version>/include
export PL_LIB_DIR=$SECONDO_SDK/lib/pl-<version>/lib/i686-linux
export PROLOG_VERSION=

# The J2SDK root directory
export J2SDK_ROOT=

# The gmp library (Really needed ???)
export GMP_LIB=gmp

# To use up and down arrow to show previous commands in some user interfaces
export readline=true

# Extending the list of directories which are used to search commands
export PATH=.:
            $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/bin:
            $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Tools/pd:
            $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Optimizer:
            $PATH

# extending the list of directories which are used by the runtime linker to
# search for dynamic link libraries 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$J2SDK_ROOT/jre/lib/i386:
                       $J2SDK_ROOT/jre/lib/i386/client:
                       $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

/*

you can check if your environment was set up correctly by calling the command
"env" if you have used the installation script there is a command alias called
"secenv" which will filter out the releveant variables and displays them. 

5 Compiling Secondo

Start a new shell and make sure that the environment variables explained in
section 4 are set. 

Change to the directory which contains the secondo source code and run make, e.g.

*/
  cd $HOME/secondo
  make
/*

Afterwards you should run

*/
  make runtests
/*

which runs some automatic tests to be sure that everything works fine. If
something fails please send a bug report to "secondo@fernuni-hagen.de"[23]


6 Installing Latex and Ghostscript

Secondo's program code documentation is made with the PD-System, which translates
program code files into LaTeX. Additonally, for previewing EPS pictures together
with LaTeX you need Ghostscript with its preview program. Hence, for using the
PD-System you have to install this software using the system administration
tools provided with your Linux system.

7 Installation Hints for other Unix based Systems

Apart from the SuSe Linux releases, other Unix like systems are conceivable, but
we have no experience in compiling and installing the development environment on
those systems. However, since all packages are compiled during installation it
should work. A problem could be the Java installation since this is a binary
version for i686-processors which will not run on other processor architectures
like power-pc or sparc.

Another problem could be that a commercial Unix derivate provided from SUN, HP,
DEC etc. does not have the gnu tools instead there are vendor specific versions
of the command shell, the C-Compiler, the Linker, the Assembler, etc. Hence we
recommend the following steps: 

  * Install bash, the gnu shell, you will find it in the"<CD>/extras/unix" 
    directory Install the gnu "binutils" package into the directory 
    "$HOME/secondo-sdk".

  * Extract the gcc packages and read carefully the installation manual of the
    gcc. In the configure step use options which define the linker and
    assembler in order to be sure that the tools of the binutils package are
    used. Install the gcc also into directory "$HOME/secondo-sdk" and set
    up your environment such that this gcc will be used. Verify it by calling
    "gcc --version".

  * Edit the installation script "installsdk". Delete the lines which
    compile the gcc.  

  * Run the script (see section 2) and follow the instructions as explained for
    Linux.

7.1 Mac-OSX

On this platform you will need the package "findutils", since our make rules
will sometimes call the "find" command with some special options which are only
available in the gnu implementation.

Before starting the installation script enter

*/

export SECONDO_PLATFORM="mac_osx"
