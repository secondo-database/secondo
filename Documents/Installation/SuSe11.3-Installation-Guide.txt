This document describes, how to create an environment able to
compile secondo on a fresh installed Open SuSe Linux 11.3.

 (1) First, be sure that the Linux system is up to date.

 (2) After a standard installation of SuSe 11.3, no develeper tools 
are installed. So, you have to install various packets to be able 
to compile Secondo. 

Start the package management (yast) and install the following packages:

  make
  flex
  bison
  libjpeg-devel
  swipl
  gsl-devel
  readline-devel
  gmp-devel
  java-1_6_0_openjdk-devel
  gcc
  gcc-c++
  graphviz-devel

Yast will report a lot of additional packages to be installed. Just accept all 
suggested changes.

 (3) Unfortunately, there is no package available including the C++ API of the
Berkeley DB. Hence, it is necessary to configure and make the Berkely DB 
manually

Get the Berkeley DB without encryption filename "db-?.?.??.NC.tar.gz"
for example from oracle.com.

copy the file into an empty directory and unpack the file using the following
command:

  tar -xzf *.tar.gz

This creates a single directory having the name of the file without .tar.gz.
Change to this directory.

After that, change to the build_unix directory and enter the commands
  
  mkdir $HOME/BDB

  ../dist/configure --prefix=$HOME/BDB --enable-cxx

This should be finished correctly

Then type

  make

and after compilation has finished, type

  make install

 (4) After finishing the installation of the Berkeley DB, a file is needed to 
set some environments variables. Because the locations for libraries and 
includes differ for 32 and 64 bit systems, two different sets of commands are 
required. Depending on your installed system, either choose the section for 32 
bit or 64 bit platforms and copy the content into a file called 
$HOME/.secondorc

If you are unsure about your system, you may type

  uname -a

to find out about the running Linux kernel.

 (5) Download and unpack the Secondo source code, so that it is rooted at
a directory ~/secondo. If you choose an other directory for the source 
root, you need to adapt the command in the next step. 

 (6) Add the following entry into the file $HOME/.bashrc file:

  source ~/.secondorc $HOME/secondo


Now, you are finally able to compile Secondo (see Secondo User's Manual).
