Secondo 3.0 Installation on Ubuntu 9.10
=======================================


1 Required Packages
-------------------

For compiling and running Secondo 3.0 on Ubuntu 9.10 you don't need 
any special versions of software packages. Just install the versions
of the tools provided by the standard system. 

On our system this was:

Berkeley-DB 4.6

gcc 4.4.1-ubuntu9
flex 2.35
bison 2.4.1
java 1.6.0
make 3.8.1
bash 4.0.33
libjpeg 6.2
libreadline 5.2
libgsl 1.12 

Install missing packages using your preferred tool 
(synaptic package manager / apt-get).


2 Installing Secondo
--------------------

Download Secondo version 3.0 (linux version) from the website:
  http://dna.fernuni-hagen.de/secondo
and unpack the file within your home directory using 
  tar -xzf <file>. 

Create a file ".secondorc" within your home directory having 
the following content:

export SECONDO_PLATFORM=linux64
export SECONDO_BUILD_DIR=$HOME/secondo
export BERKELEY_DB_LIB="db_cxx"
export BERKELEY_DB_DIR=/usr
export J2SDK_ROOT=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.15/
export SWI_HOME_DIR=/usr/lib/swi-prolog
export PL_LIB_DIR=$SWI_HOME_DIR/lib/amd64
export PL_INCLUDE_DIR=$SWI_HOME_DIR/include
export PL_VERSION=50647
export SECONDO_JAVA=$J2SDK_ROOT/bin/java
export readline=true
export PATH=$PATH:.:$SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Tools/pd
export SECONDO_CONFIG=$SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/bin/SecondoConfig.ini
export JAVAVER=1.6

alias secroot='export SECONDO_BUILD_DIR=$PWD'


If you want to run Secondo on a 32 bit Ubuntu, change the first line to
export SECONDO_PLATFORM=linux
You may also need to adjust some path variables, especially PL_LIB_DIR has to
be set according to your local platform.

Edit your file ".bashrc" located in your home directory by adding the following 
lines:

source .secondorc

Close your terminal and start a new bash. 

After that you have to patch Secondo to run on Ubuntu. To do so, just
call from the bash:
  $HOME/secondo/CM-Scripts/patchUbuntu804

Then you can compile Secondo:

  cd secondo
  make

Read the Secondo User Manual for further instructions and enjoy the
Secondo extensible database system.
