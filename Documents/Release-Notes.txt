2011-07-20 Notes on Release 3.1.0
===============================================================================

(1) GUI

The Java based GUI was extended to support tiled maps from OSM or google as 
backgrounds. Brief explanations on tiled map backgrounds are available from 
the Secondo User Manual ($SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Documents/SecondoManual.pdf), 
Section 5.3.5.

The Java interface to Secondo was separated from the remainder of the GUI to 
be able to develop own applications using Secondo.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) Secondo Kernel: Framework

New control structures (conditionals, loops, sequences) have been added to the
Secondo interface, allowing for sophisticated scripting. See Secondo
User Manual ($SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Documents/SecondoManual.pdf), Section 3.

Function database objects returning stream results are handled correctly now.
Several more bug fixes improve the stability of the system.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) Secondo Kernel:  Algebra Modules

New Algebra: SpatialJoinAlgebra

This algebra provides a new implementation of a spatialjoin operator.
This algorithm was assigned the operator name 'spatialjoin'.
The old spatialjoin operator implementation (RTree PlugJoin) has been renamed 
to spatialjoin0.

Within the previously released algebras, version 3.1.0 brings some new operators.
Some operators and types have been renamed in order to avoid confusion and to
harmonize the naming schema.

A few operators have been removed, because they were actually doublets.


StandardAlgebra:
================
Added operators:
    abs: real -> real, int -> int
    arccos: {int | real} -> real
    arcsin: {int | real} -> real
    arctan: {int | real} -> real
    arctan2: real x real -> real
    const_e: -> real
    const_pi: -> real
    cos: {int | real} -> real
    deg2rad: {int | real} -> real
    dms2deg: {int|real} x {int|real} [x {int|real}] [x bool] -> real
    logB: {int | real} x {int | real} -> real
    pow: {int | real} x {int | real} -> real
    rad2deg: {int | real} -> real
    sin: {int | real} -> real
    tan: {int | real} -> real

Comment:
    - arithmetic and trigonometric functions and constants have been added


FTextAlgebra:
=============
Added operators:
    isValidID: string [ x bool] -> bool
    attr2text: DATA -> text
    charToText: int -> text
    sendtextstreamTCP: stream({string|text}) x {string|text} x {string|text} x {int|real} x {int|real} -> stream(tuple((Ok bool)(Msg text)(ErrMsg string))), 2<=n<=4
    tokenize: text x string -> stream(text)
    strequal: {string, text} x {string, text} x bool -> bool
    checkOperatorTypeMap2: string x {text | string}  -> text
    checkOperatorTypeMap: string x ANY -> text
    sys_getAlgebraId: {string|text} -> int
    sys_getAlgebraName: int -> string
    sys_getMatchingOperators: int x ANY -> R, {string|text} x int -> R,
	where R = stream(tuple((OperatorName:string,OperatorId:int,AlgebraName:string,AlgebraId:int,ResultType:text,
                                Signature:text,Syntax:text,Meaning:text,Example:text,Remark:text)))
    matchingOperators: ANY -> stream(tuple((OperatorName:string,OperatorId:int,AlgebraName:string,AlgebraId:int,
                                            ResultType:text,Signature:text,Syntax:text,Meaning:text,Example:text,Remark:text)))
    matchingOperatorNames:  ANY -> stream(string)
    getDatabaseName: -> string

Bugfixes:
    - keywords

Renamed operators:
    - toobject  ==> toObject

Comments:
    - getDatabaseName returns the name of the currrently open database
    - sys_getMatchingOperators / matchingOperators / matchingOperatorNames allow to
      find operators matching a given parameter signature.
    - isValidID checks whether a string represents a valid (and free to use)
      identifier for a database object or an attribute name.

ImExAlgebra:
============
Added operators:
    getPID: -> int
    getPageSize: -> int
    getSecondoVersion: -> int
    getSecondoPlatform: -> string
    getBDBVersion: -> int
    dbimport2: text -> stream (tuple(...))
    shpimport2: text -> stream(T), T in {point, points, line, region}
    nmeaimport: text x string -> streamtuple( TL ))
    nmeaimport_line: text x string -> stream(tuple( TL ))
    get_lines: {text,string} -> stream(text)

Bugfixes
    - The file length value in shpexport has been corrected.

Changed operators:
    - shpexport: stream(X) x  string -> stream(X),
                 stream(tuple(...))) x string x bool x bool -> stream(tuple...)

Comments:
    - shpexport allows to create the corresponding shape index file now.
      This will tackle problems importing data generated by Secondo.
    - dbimport2 / shpimport2 allow to import without prior creation of
      the template relation as required by dbimport / shpimport
    - get_lines allows to read a file line by line. On Linux systems,
      you can also read from arbitrary device files, e.g. to import
      position history or stream data from a GPS device.
    - nmeaimport / nmeaimport_line allow for reading the most important
      NMEA sentences from texts

GraphAlgebra:
=============
Renamed operators:
    key ==> get_key
    pos ==> get_pos
    source ==> get_source
    target ==> get_target
    cost ==> get_cost

Comment:
    - The operators have been renamed to avoid conflicts with typical
      attribute names

SpatialAlgebra:
===============
Added Type:
    geoid

Added Operators:
    create_triangle: point x point x point -> region
    heading2direction: real -> real
    direction2heading: real -> real
    midpointBetween: point x point [x geoid] [x real] -> point
    point2string: point [x geoid] -> string
    create_geoid: string [ x {real|int} x {real|int} -> geoid
    getFlattening: geoid -> real
    getRadius: geoid -> real
    distanceOrthodrome: point x point [x geoid] -> real
    reverseGk: t -> t, t in {point, points, line, region}

Changed Operators:
    bbox: point||points||line||region||sline) [x geoid]-> rect
    size: {line|sline} x geoid -> real
    direction: point x point [x geoid] -> real
    heading: point x point [x geoid] -> real
    size: line|sline|region} -> real,  {line|sline} x geoid -> real

Comments:
    - Datatype geoid was added to represent different geoids used for
      spherical geometry calculations with geographic coordinates
    - The most used geoids have been predefined. See operator create_geoid.
    - Many operators now have an optional geoid-parameter. Using it will
      make the operator work with geographic (LON/LAT) rather than planar
      (X/Y) coordinates and spherical rather than euclidean geometry.
    - The meaning of 'heading' and 'direction' has been clarified
      normalized  throughout Secondo: From now on, 'heading' means
      navigational angles 0<Phi<=360 (360= TRUE NORTH, 90= EAST, ...), while
      'direction' uses the standard mathematical notion for angles, 0<=Phi<360
      (0 = parallel to the X-axis, following increasing X-value, 90 = parallel
      to the Y-axis, following increasing Y-values).

TemporalAlgebra:
================

Changed operators:
    bbox: upoint [x geoid] -> rect3,
          mpoint [x geoid] -> rect3,
          ipoint [x geoid] -> rect3,
          instant          -> rect3,
          periods          -> rect3
    bbox2d: upoint [x geoid] -> rect,
            mpoint [x geoid] -> rect,
            ipoint [x geoid] -> rect
    bboxold: upoint [x geoid] -> rect3,
             mpoint [x geoid] -> rect3,
             ipoint [x geoid] -> rect3,
             rT               -> rT
    length: mpoint [x string] -> real
    avg_speed: mpoint [ x string ] -> real
    delay: mpoint x mpoint [x geoid] -> mreal
    distancetraversed: mpoint [x geoid] -> mreal
    turns: mpoint x real x real [x duration] [x bool] [x geoid]
           -> stream(tuple(TimeOld instant, TimeNew instant, PosOld point,
                           PosNew point, HeadingOld real,
                           HeadingNew real, HeadingDiff real))

Comments:
    - various operators can now deal with geographic coordinates when
      provided with a geoid parameter.

TemporalLiftedAlgebra:
======================
Added operators:
    +, -, *, /: {mreal, mint, real, int} x {mreal, mint, real,int} -> {mreal, mint}

TemporalExtAlgebra:
===================
Changed operators:
    speed_new: mpoint [ x geoid ] -> mreal
    direction: mpoint [ x geoid [ x real ] ] -> mreal
    heading: mpoint [ x geoid [ x real ] ] -> mreal

Comments:
    - Many operators now have an optional geoid-parameter. Using it will
      make the operator work with geographic (LON/LAT) rather than planar
      (X/Y) coordinates and spherical rather than euclidean geometry.
    - The meaning of 'heading' and 'direction' has been clarified
      normalized  throughout Secondo: From now on, 'heading' means
      navigational angles 0<Phi<=360 (360= TRUE NORTH, 90= EAST, ...), while
      'direction' uses the standard mathematical notion for angles, 0<=Phi<360
      (0 = parallel to the X-axis, following increasing X-value, 90 = parallel
      to the Y-axis, following increasing Y-values).


MovingRegionAlgebra:
====================
Renamed types:
    movingregion ==> mregion
    intimeregion ==> iregion

Comments:
    - Types 'movingregion' and 'intimeregion' have been renamed in order
      to achieve a general naming schema for moving and intime types.


RecordAlgebra:
=============
Changed Operators and types:
    -   record now allows for arbitrary valid identifiers as fields
        names, they are not required to start with a capital letter any more.

HistogramAlgebra:
=================
Removed operators:
    is_undefined:

Comments:
    - In order to achieve a uniform handling of definedness, the
      operator is_undefined has been removed.
      Use the generic isdefined: DATA -> bool instead.

DateTimeAlgebra:
================
Comments:
    - The toString(true) function of DateTime allows to export timestamps in
      SQL92 formatting (using a blanc as separator between date and time).
      This is now used by operator toCSVtext: instant -> string
    - The fromString function of DateTime allows to import timestamps in
      SQL92 formatting (using a blanc as separator between date and time).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4) Optimizer

The standard syntax translation for Secondo operators is now deprecated. You
must explicitly specify the syntax for each operator in file opsyntax.pl now.
Also, the notation of the syntax and the generic translation rules in
plan_to_atom/2 have been changed. Please refer to Section 8.5 in the Secondo
User Manual and Sections 7.2.2-7.2.3 in the Secondo Programmer's Guide
($SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Documents/ProgrammersGuide.pdf).

On SQL-level, in user defined aggregations, the default-value can now be passed
as a constant value expression, not as a string literal anymore.
Constants can now also be expressed using terms like value_expr(<Type>,<Value>)
where <Type> is a Prolog term for the type descriptor and <Value> is the nested
list representation of the constant value, both using round parantheses and
commas internally.

2007-06-24 Notes on Release 3.0
===============================================================================

Secondo has been improved significantly since version 2.9. Mayor points are the
improved compatibility with different platforms, increased stability, and
increased performance.

Although we did our best to improve general system stability, there are still
some problems with numeric stability, especially in the spatial and
spatiotemporal algebras.

Changes in detail:

 * The Flob concept has been totally re-implemented to avoid the nasty errors
   created by the old Flob-Cache.

 * Several changes have been done to make the SMI code compatible with
   different versions of 3rd party software, namely BerkeleyDB, thus increasing
   compatibility with different platforms.

 * On some platforms, newer library versions miss to include certain header
   files. These are now included explicitly.

 * Many bugfixes regarding system stability: Memory holes have been fixed,
   some operator implementations corrected.

 * For spatial and spatiotemporal datatypes with set semantics, we now
   differentiate between EMPTY and UNDEFINED values.

 * New support structure "TupleFile": This type can be used by algorithms
   that need to materialize data. Data is stored in flat files rather than
   in temporal relations. Also, only data not fitting into the main memory
   buffer gets materialized on harddisc. Should be used as an replacement for
   the "TupleBuffer".

 * Changed implementations/ New algebra: The ExtRelation-2Algebra provides
   external Algorithms for sorting and different join algorithms. Also,
   sorting is now done by a paramerizable multi-stage mergesort, with restricted
   amount of main memory. The new algorithms use TupleFiles instead of
   TupleBuffers.
   Most according original algorithms from the ExtRelationAlgebra have been
   replaced by the operators from this new algebra.

 * New operators in the RTreeAlgebra allow for query-based inspection of the
   tree structures.

 * New modules: The BTree2Algebra provides parametrizable BTrees. The
   RTreeViewer allows for visualized online-exploration of Rtree objects.

 * Optimizer: Exception handling was extended so that now most errors can be
   caught and reported to the user.
   Scripts for executing the BerlinMOD/R benchmark from the optimizer have
   been added to the Optimizer directory.

2007-09-17 Notes on Release 2.5
===============================================================================

If you plan to set up an SDK using "openSuSe 10.2" you can use the system's gcc
(e.g. installsdk -s) which reports the version

  gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux).

Please refer to the Installation-Guide for detailed explanations. Moreover, if
you have a 64 bit linux system you need

 * Berkeley-DB 4.3.29 (older versions don't compile and
   for higher versions our code is not ready)

 * A 64 bit Java-Installation of JDK 1.5

 * A Prolog System which is compiled with the JPL package (SuSe's standard
   version does not provide this).

Maybe in the future we will provide an SDK for 64 bit systems, but currently
you have to scrape along with this few hints.



New features:
-------------

 * Bug fixes for operators in various algebra modules.

 * The source code is now sufficient for linux 64 bit systems.
   Windows 64 bit has not been tested, and we don't plan to do so
   in the near future.

 * Optionally, query progress estimation can be enabled.

 * A new algebra for representing graphs has been added.

M. Spiekermann


2007-03-21 Notes on Release 2.4
===============================================================================

The release deployed at March 14 runs into compiler errors. As work around you
need to delete two files, please execute the commands below:

  cd Javagui/tools
  rm *Disturber*

If you plan to set up an SDK using "openSuSe 10.2" you can use the system's gcc
(e.g. installsdk -s) which reports the version

  gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux).

Please refer to the Installation-Guide for detailed explanations.

New features:
-------------

 * Many bug fixes of operators in various algebra modules.

 * Provision of a test database called "berlintest".

 * The example queries for operators are now working on database berlintest.
   They are collected in a system table called SEC2OPERATORINFO. This may
   help you to find "running" examples and to learn more quickly about the
   capabilities of the implemented algebra modules.

 * Implementation of a quick regression test called "Selftest". It runs all
   examples on berlintest and compares them with result sets. We decided to
   put the database and the results into the source tree. This blowed up the
   archive's size but gives all users the chance to test whether their own
   implementations make the system instable or not.


Best Regards
