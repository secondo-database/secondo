===============================================================================

If you plan to set up an SDK using "openSuSe 10.2" you can use the system's gcc
(e.g. installsdk -s) which reports the version 

  gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux).

Please refer to the Installation-Guide for detailed explanations. Moreover, if
you have a 64 bit linux system you need

 * Berkeley-DB 4.3.29 (older versions don't compile and 
   for higher versions our code is not ready)

 * A 64 bit Java-Installation of JDK 1.5

 * A Prolog System which is compiled with the JPL package (SuSe's standard
   version does not provide this).

Maybe in the future we will provide an SDK for 64 bit systems, but currently
you have to scrape along with this few hints.



New features:
-------------

 * Bug fixes for operators in various algebra modules.

 * The source code is now sufficient for linux 64 bit systems. 
   Windows 64 bit has not been tested, and we don't plan to do so 
   in the near future.

 * Optionally, query progress estimation can be enabled.

 * A new algebra for representing graphs has been added.

2007-03-21 Notes on Release 2.4 
===============================================================================

The release deployed at March 14 runs into compiler errors. As work around you
need to delete two files, please execute the commands below: 

  cd Javagui/tools
  rm *Disturber*

If you plan to set up an SDK using "openSuSe 10.2" you can use the system's gcc
(e.g. installsdk -s) which reports the version 

  gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux).

Please refer to the Installation-Guide for detailed explanations.

New features:
-------------

 * Many bug fixes of operators in various algebra modules.

 * Provision of a test database called "berlintest".

 * The example queries for operators are now working on database berlintest.
   They are collected in a system table called SEC2OPERATORINFO. This may
   help you to find "running" examples and to learn more quickly about the
   capabilities of the implemented algebra modules.  

 * Implementation of a quick regression test called "Selftest". It runs all 
   examples on berlintest and compares them with result sets. We decided to
   put the database and the results into the source tree. This blowed up the
   archive's size but gives all users the chance to test whether their own
   implementations make the system instable or not.
